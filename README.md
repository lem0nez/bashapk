# BashAPK
This repository contains various Bash scripts that simplify editing of
decompiled Android applications. The main goal is make easier to create “light”
version of applications. Supported tools are
[Apktool](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool) and
[MT Manager](https://binmt.cc/doc/en).

## imgoptim
Optimizes all specified **PNG** (using `optipng`) and **JPEG** (using
`jpegoptim`) images, or images from specified directories recursively. It uses
lossless optimization options and calculates total freed space. You can disable
calculations to speed up optimization process. Example of use:
```
imgoptim --list ../optimized-files.list assets/image.png res/
```

## rmdupes
Removes duplicate files from specified directories. For example, if you have
following resource folders:
```
drawable-hdpi
drawable-xhdpi
drawable-xxhdpi
```
and your screen has the **XHDPI** density, then following command:
```
rmdupes drawable-xhdpi drawable-xxhdpi drawable-hdpi
```
will delete all found duplicate graphics, starting from the second folder. You
can also pass a directory of the decompiled by MT Manager `resources.arsc` file
(`--arsc` option) to delete corresponding paths from XML files.

How to prioritize directories sequence of APK resources you can read
[here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources#AlternativeResources).

## rmdupes-arsc
Removes duplicate resources from specified XML files. For instance, if you have
following XML files, that decompiled by MT Manager:
```
style.xml
style-v21.xml
style-v28.xml
```
and your Android version is **5.1** (API 22), then to delete unnecessary
duplicate resources you should use the following command:
```
rmdupes-arsc style-v21.xml style.xml style-v28.xml
```
The same logic, but for the Apktool's files hierarchy:
```
rmdupes-arsc values-v21/styles.xml values/styles.xml values-v28/styles.xml
```

## patchapk
With this script you can apply some of the following patches (in the square
brackets noted which tools a patch supports):
- `rm-langs` _[Apktool]_. Remove unused languages (only `values` folders). You
  can change pattern of the language code that will be kept by editing the
  `KEEP_LANG` variable inside the patch script. By default it's `en`.
- `rm-debug-info` _[Apktool, MT Manager]_. Remove debug information from Smali
  code to reduce size of compiled DEX file.
- `rm-dummies` _[Apktool]_. Remove unnecessary “dummy” items (generated by
  Apktool) from application resources.
- `no-ads` _[Apktool]_. Disable ads. Original implementation by Maximoff
  [here](https://github.com/Maximoff/ApkEditor-Patches).
- `no-analytics` _[Apktool, MT Manager]_. Disable analytic reports.
- `no-billing` _[Apktool, MT Manager]_. Disable the billing service to reduce
  RAM usage by an application.

When working with files that decompiled by MT Manager, it's will be better to
pass the `--use-xmlstarlet` option to improve matching of XML elements.
